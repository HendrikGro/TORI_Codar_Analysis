# Data access
- CODAR Data has to be requested from TORI
- ERA5 Reanalysis data has been downloaded <a href='https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels?tab=overview'>here</a>
- CMEMS Geostrophic velocities have been downloaded <a href='https://data.marine.copernicus.eu/product/SEALEVEL_GLO_PHY_L4_MY_008_047/description'>here</a>
- Data is also uploaded to this <a href='https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/123c0nMKXRjGUTvTouFZwdco87Ax_lnPF?usp=sharing'>Google Drive</a>
  - You can request access for that
  - But as I am not regularly checking this gmail account, better open an issue here, so I get a GitHub notification.

# Run these codes
You can use my docker container for scientific computing. See description and how to use here https://github.com/hgrosselindemann/docker-jlab

I did not have time to really comment my code, I am sorry for that. I added decsriptions on the functions I defined. If you have any questions feel free to ask. Or you can copy the code into ChatGPT and let the AI explain it to you. It works pretty well :D
